## Instructions for Committing Changes from Your Local Unity Project to the GitHub Repository
1. Cloning the Repository: Find a local folder where you want to clone this repository. Clone the main branch first. For an easier workflow, I recommend using GitHub Desktop to handle cloning, committing, and pushing changes. Here's a YouTube video that explains how to use GitHub Desktop if you're unfamiliar with it—it's much simpler than using the command line.

3. Setting Up the Unity Project: After cloning the repository, you can either: Create a new Unity project directly inside the cloned folder, or copy your entire existing Unity project into the cloned folder.
4. Managing File Size Limits: To avoid exceeding GitHub’s file size limits, my gitignore file ignores a Vuforia tgz file 'com.ptc.vuforia.engine-10.25.4.tgz' from the 'Packages' folder. Remember this file is still needed when opening this project, so do not delete it.
5. Creating a Branch & Committing Changes: Use GitHub Desktop to create your personal branch. Then, commit and push all of your changes to this branch.

## What Will Be in Our Branches:
Your branches will contain the essential Assets and Packages information except the vuforia tgz file. Unity will automatically regenerate any other necessary files when you open the project, so first copy the 'com.ptc.vuforia.engine-10.25.4.tgz' file back to the packages folder, and you are good to get started.
